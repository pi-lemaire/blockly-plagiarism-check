# blockly-plagiarism-check
This script matches variable IDs from XML files generated under blockly. It searches a folder and its subfolders (generated by a moodle platform) for all .txt files and tries to decode the xml content when possible. In our case, the student name is part of the subfolder name or the file name.
It also looks for the teacher name by parsing the folder name which starts with the subject prefix, specified at the beginning of the file
